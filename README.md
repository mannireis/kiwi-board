# Kiwi Board

The Kiwi Board is a 42-key split keyboard designed for stenographic input. It features a 3×6 column-staggered layout with 3 thumb keys per side.  
The design is based on the [Polyglot keyboard](https://stenokeyboards.com/products/polyglot-keyboard) and includes an integrated RP2040 microcontroller.

This project started after I discovered steno and wanted to build a keyboard tailored for learning and experimenting with chorded input.
