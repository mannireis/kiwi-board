# Total time: 12 hours 25 minutes

## July 22 — 3h 10m

I started by making the schematic, which took about 1 hour since this keyboard is more complex due to the integrated RP2040.

Then I spent the rest of the time designing the PCB and wiring everything together.

## July 23 — 45m

I made a few changes to the PCB, such as repositioning some keys and adjusting the RP2040's location.

## July 25 — 3h 30m

I started making the case. I designed the plate and began working on the bottom half!

## July 26 — 2h

I finished the case — it turned out really cool and feels quite good, I think!

## July 27 — 3h

I fixed the USB setup since I had used a USB-C plug instead of a receptacle. I also added some header pins for debugging!

Also made a bare working firmware!!!
